# Splunk CLI Tool (splunk-cli)

**splunk-cli** is a powerful and lightweight command-line interface (CLI) tool written in Go for interacting with the Splunk REST API. It allows you to efficiently execute SPL (Search Processing Language) queries, manage search jobs, and retrieve results directly from your terminal or in scripts.

## Features

- **Automation**: Trigger Splunk searches from shell scripts or CI/CD jobs and pipe the results into subsequent processes.
- **Efficiency**: Quickly check data with a single command without opening the Web UI.
- **Flexible Authentication**: Manage credentials via command-line flags, environment variables, a configuration file, or a secure interactive prompt.
- **Long-Running Job Management**: The asynchronous execution model (`start`, `status`, `results`) allows you to manage heavy search jobs that may take hours, without tying up your terminal.
- **App Context**: Use the `--app` flag to run searches within a specific app context, enabling the use of app-specific lookups and knowledge objects.

## Installation

There are two ways to install `splunk-cli`:

### 1. From a Release (Recommended)

You can download the pre-compiled binary for your operating system (macOS, Linux, Windows) from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/magifd2/splunk-cli/releases).

### 2. From Source

If you have Go installed, you can build the tool from the source code.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/magifd2/splunk-cli.git
cd splunk-cli

# Build the binary
make build

# The executable will be in the dist/ directory, e.g., dist/macos/splunk-cli
```

## Usage

### Configuration

The most convenient way to use the tool is by creating a configuration file.

**Path**: `~/.config/splunk-cli/config.json`

**Example Content**:
```json
{
  "host": "https://your-splunk-instance.com:8089",
  "token": "your-splunk-token-here",
  "app": "search",
  "insecure": true,
  "httpTimeout": "60s",
  "limit": 100
}
```

### Configuration Priority

Settings are evaluated in the following order of precedence (highest priority first):

1.  **Command-line Flags** (e.g., `--config <path>`)
2.  **Command-line Flags (specific)** (e.g., `--host <URL>`)
3.  **Environment Variables** (e.g., `SPLUNK_HOST`, `SPLUNK_APP`)
4.  **Configuration File**

### Global Flags

These flags can be used with any command:

- `--config <path>`: Path to a custom configuration file. Overrides the default `~/.config/splunk-cli/config.json`.
- `--version`: Print version information and exit.

### Commands

`splunk-cli` provides a set of commands for different tasks.

#### `run`

Starts a search, waits for it to complete, and displays the results.

**Examples**:
```bash
# Search data from the last hour, limiting to 10 results
splunk-cli run --spl "index=_internal" --earliest "-1h" --limit 10

# Read SPL from a file and execute
cat my_query.spl | splunk-cli run -f -
```

- `--spl <string>`: The SPL query to execute.
- `--file <path>` or `-f <path>`: Read the SPL query from a file. Use `-` for stdin.
- `--earliest <time>`: The earliest time for the search (e.g., -1h, @d, 1672531200).
- `--latest <time>`: The latest time for the search (e.g., now, @d, 1672617600).
- `--timeout <duration>`: Total timeout for the job (e.g., 10m, 1h30m).
- `--limit <int>`: Maximum number of results to return (0 for all).
- `--silent`: Suppress progress messages.

> **💡 Ctrl+C Behavior**: When you press `Ctrl+C` during a `run` command, you can choose to either cancel the job or let it continue running in the background.

#### `start`

Starts a search job and immediately prints the Job ID (SID) to stdout.

**Example**:
```bash
export JOB_ID=$(splunk-cli start --spl "index=main | stats count by sourcetype")
echo "Job started with SID: $JOB_ID"
```

#### `status`

Checks the status of a specified job SID.

**Example**:
```bash
splunk-cli status --sid "$JOB_ID"
```

#### `results`

Fetches the results of a completed job. This is useful in combination with tools like `jq`.

**Example**:
```bash
# Fetch up to 50 results for a given job
splunk-cli results --sid "$JOB_ID" --limit 50 --silent | jq .
```

- `--sid <string>`: The Search ID (SID) of the job.
- `--limit <int>`: Maximum number of results to return (0 for all).

### Common Flags

These flags are available for most commands:

- `--host <url>`: The URL of the Splunk server.
- `--token <string>`: The authentication token.
- `--user <string>`: The username.
- `--password <string>`: The password (will be prompted for if not provided).
- `--app <string>`: The app context for the search.
- `--owner <string>`: The owner of knowledge objects within the app (defaults to `nobody`).
- `--limit <int>`: Maximum number of results to return (0 for all). The default is 0 (all results).
- `--insecure`: Skip TLS certificate verification.
- `--http-timeout <duration>`: Timeout for individual API requests (e.g., 30s, 1m).
- `--debug`: Enable detailed debug logging.
- `--version`: Print version information.

## Development

This project uses a `Makefile` for common development tasks.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `make build` | Build binary for the current platform |
| `make build-all` | Cross-compile for all target platforms |
| `make test` | Run unit tests |
| `make check` | Full quality gate: vet → lint → test → build |
| `make integration-test` | Run integration tests against a live Splunk container (requires Podman) |
| `make splunk-down` | Stop and remove the Splunk test container |
| `make clean` | Remove build artifacts |

See [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for detailed build and test instructions.
